abstract = "Complex computer simulations are commonly required for accurate data modelling in many scientific disciplines, making statistical inference challenging due to the intractability of the likelihood evaluation for the observed data. Furthermore, sometimes one is interested on inference drawn over a subset of the generative model parameters while taking into account model uncertainty or misspecification on the remaining nuisance parameters. In this work, we show how non-linear summary statistics can be constructed by minimising inference-motivated losses via stochastic gradient descent such that they provide the smallest uncertainty for the parameters of interest. As a use case, the problem of confidence interval estimation for the mixture coefficient in a multi-dimensional two-component mixture model (i.e.Â signal vs background) is considered, where the proposed technique clearly outperforms summary statistics based on probabilistic classification, a commonly used alternative which does not account for the presence of nuisance parameters."

  abstract  = "An efficient learner is one who reuses what they already know to tackle a new problem. For a machine learner, this means understanding the similarities amongst datasets. In order to do this, one must take seriously the idea of working with datasets, rather than datapoints, as the key objects to model. Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used for: clustering datasets, transferring generative models to new datasets, selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen classes. We refer to our model as a neural statistician, and by this we mean a neural network that can learn to compute summary statistics of datasets without supervision.",

abstract = {Many inference problems involve data generation processes that are not uniquely specified or are uncertain in some way. In a scientific context, the presence of several plausible data generation processes is often associated to the presence of systematic uncertainties. Robust inference is possible if it is based on a pivot -- a quantity whose distribution is invariant to the unknown value of the (categorical or continuous) nuisance parameters that parametrizes this family of generation processes. In this work, we introduce a flexible training procedure based on adversarial networks for enforcing the pivotal property on a predictive model. We derive theoretical results showing that the proposed algorithm tends towards a minimax solution corresponding to a predictive model that is both optimal and independent of the nuisance parameters (if that models exists) or for which one can tune the trade-off between power and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with a toy example and an example from particle physics.},

abstract = {Stereotactic radiosurgery (SR) is a standard therapy for brain metastases. Radiation necrosis (RN) of the brain is a syndrome of brain coagulative and fibrinoid necrosis and cortical irritation that occurs following radiotherapy. RN following SR peaks in a delayed fashion at 9-12 months postprocedure. Vasogenic cerebral edema secondary to necrosis occurs and can affect surrounding brain function. No definitive non-invasive diagnostic study exists to differentiate post-SR RN from recurrent metastatic tumor. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, and perfusion-weighted MR imaging have been used to evaluate RN and are discussed. Treatment options for post-SR brain metastases include observation, corticosteroids, pentoxifylline and vitamin E, bevacizumab, radiotherapy, laser-interstitial thermal therapy, and surgical resection.},

abstract = {In many fields of science, generalized likelihood ratio tests are established tools for statistical inference. At the same time, it has become increasingly common that a simulator (or generative model) is used to describe complex processes that tie parameters $\theta$ of an underlying theory and measurement apparatus to high-dimensional observations $\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^p$. However, simulator often do not provide a way to evaluate the likelihood function for a given observation $\mathbf{x}$, which motivates a new class of likelihood-free inference algorithms. In this paper, we show that likelihood ratios are invariant under a specific class of dimensionality reduction maps $\mathbb{R}^p \mapsto \mathbb{R}$. As a direct consequence, we show that discriminative classifiers can be used to approximate the generalized likelihood ratio statistic when only a generative model for the data is available. This leads to a new machine learning-based approach to likelihood-free inference that is complementary to Approximate Bayesian Computation, and which does not require a prior on the model parameters. Experimental results on artificial problems with known exact likelihoods illustrate the potential of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Discriminative learning methods for classification perform well when\ntraining and test data are drawn from the same distribution. Often,\nhowever, we have plentiful labeled training data from a source domain\nbut wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain\nwith a different distribution and little or no labeled training data. In\nthis work we investigate two questions. First, under what conditions can\na classifier trained from source data be expected to perform well on\ntarget data? Second, given a small amount of labeled target data, how\nshould we combine it during training with the large amount of labeled\nsource data to achieve the lowest target error at test time?\nWe address the first question by bounding a classifier's target error in\nterms of its source error and the divergence between the two domains. We\ngive a classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from\nfinite, unlabeled samples from the domains. Under the assumption that\nthere exists some hypothesis that performs well in both domains, we show\nthat this quantity together with the empirical source error characterize\nthe target error of a source-trained classifier.\nWe answer the second question by bounding the target error of a model\nwhich minimizes a convex combination of the empirical source and target\nerrors. Previous theoretical work has considered minimizing just the\nsource error, just the target error, or weighting instances from the two\ndomains equally. We show how to choose the optimal combination of source\nand target error as a function of the divergence, the sample sizes of\nboth domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class. The resulting\nbound generalizes the previously studied cases and is always at least as\ntight as a bound which considers minimizing only the target error or an\nequal weighting of source and target errors.},

abstract = {The Higgs boson is thought to provide the interaction that imparts mass to the fundamental fermions, but while measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are consistent with this hypothesis, current analysis techniques lack the statistical power to cross the traditional 5$\sigma$ significance barrier without more data. \emph{Deep learning} techniques have the potential to increase the statistical power of this analysis by \emph{automatically} learning complex, high-level data representations. In this work, deep neural networks are used to detect the decay of the Higgs to a pair of tau leptons. A Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to tune the network architecture and training algorithm hyperparameters, resulting in a deep network of eight non-linear processing layers that improves upon the performance of shallow classifiers even without the use of features specifically engineered by physicists for this application. The improvement in discovery significance is equivalent to an increase in the accumulated dataset of 25\%.},

@article{Glorot2010,
abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ï¬rst observe the inï¬uence of the non-linear activations functions. We ï¬nd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ï¬nd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ï¬nd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneï¬cial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difï¬cult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

@article{Ganin2016,
abstract = {We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identification application.},

@article{silver_mastering_2016,
abstract = {The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ?value networks? to evaluate board positions and ?policy networks? to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},
